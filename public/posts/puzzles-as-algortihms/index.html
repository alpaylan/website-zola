 This article is a brief advocacy for the use of puzzles as
        algorithmic problems for learning purposes as an alternative to the
        current style of Competitive Programming(CP) or Mathematics
        problems.
</p>
<p>
 The current trend in “how to learn algorithms” is mostly based on big
        tech companies and their interview process. This process is interleaved
        with the ICPC(International Collegiate Programming Contest) style of
        competitive programming, where a problem is usually a combination or
        adaptation of several known algorithms or mathematical concepts. I see
        four problems with this approach:
</p>
<ol type="1">
 <li>
  <strong>
   The problems are not real-world problems
  </strong>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   The problems have pre-defined and determined
                solutions
  </strong>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   The problems are very hard to solve if you don’t already
                know the solution
  </strong>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   The problems are not fun
  </strong>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 Let me elaborate on these points by walking through the process of
        solving a LeetCode problem. I picked a medium problem with 34.5% solve
        rate, 3Sum. The problem statement is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i],
            nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] +
            nums[j] + nums[k] == 0. Notice that the solution set must not contain
            duplicate triplets.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The naive solution would be to simply brute force the entire array,
        which would be O(n^3). This is obviously not the intended solution, so
        we are led to think where we can optimize. A classic approach for array
        questions is to first sort the array in the hope that it will allow for
        some optimization in the algorithm. After sorting the array, we can use
        the two-pointer technique to find the triplets.
</p>
<p>
 As you might’ve realized when reading the above paragraph, I didn’t
        invent anything when solving the question. In fact, the author already
        had an optimal solution, as well as a naive one, when they were writing
        the question. This is a common theme in competitive programming
        problems. The author has some solution in mind, usually by combining a
        few techniques or algorithms in a clever way, and the problem solver has
        to figure out that specific solution.
</p>
<p>
 This is in stark contrast to real-world problems. In a real-world
        problem, there is no “existing” solution that you have to discover. Of
        course the tricks and techniques you learn from competitive programming
        can be applied to real-world problems, but the process of solving a
        real-world problem is much more open-ended. You also need to decide on
        your constraints yourself, unlike the constraints given in competitive
        programming problems.
 <strong>
  What does it mean for your algorithm to be
            “fast enough”?
 </strong>
 Even further,
 <strong>
  what does it mean for your
            algorithm to be “correct”?
 </strong>
 In CP, the answer is usually “passes
        all test cases”, but in the real world, the answer is not so
        clear-cut.
</p>
<p>
 Given such discrepancies, I am proposing solving puzzles by devising
        algorithms for them as an alternative to CP problems. The puzzles are
        actually fun to work with, they aren’t designed to be solved
        algorithmically, so there is no solution you have to discover, you
        actually have to invent a solution. These puzzles can be anything from
        variants of Sudoku to small Chess problems, any puzzle that doesn’t
        require any special knowledge to solve. The fact that you have to define
        your own constraints makes solving puzzles a much better approximation
        of real-world problem solving than CP problems. Solving a puzzle
        algorithmically means that
 <strong>
  (1)
 </strong>
 you must define your
        constraint for correctness and performance, as well as the space of
        inputs you are interested in,
 <strong>
  (2)
 </strong>
 you must devise a
        robust testing strategy,
 <strong>
  (3)
 </strong>
 you must model the problem
        space as a data structure in the programming language, perhaps think
        about the trade-offs between different representations of the problem
        space,
 <strong>
  (4)
 </strong>
 you must devise an algorithm that solves the
        problem, and
 <strong>
  (5)
 </strong>
 you must implement the algorithm and
        test it.
 <strong>
  Together, I believe these steps are a much better
            approximation of real-world problem solving than CP
            problems.

  Figure 1

 an example of a puzzle that I solved
        recently. Your task is to find a set of
 <em>
  brushes
 </em>
 that paint the
        source into the target canvas. For this particular example, brushing
        order A-F-B-D is the solution.
 <strong>
  Can you devise a general
            algorithm for solving this puzzle for any source and target canvas in
            any size?
