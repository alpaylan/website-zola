As a group of Turkish software professionals and researchers, we run a reading group at the intersection of computer science and software engineering. We meet bi-weekly to discuss papers, books, and other resources that are relevant to our interests. Here are the previous groups we've had:

- [Street Coder](https://www.streetcoder.org/)
- [Distributed Paper Stacks](https://groups.google.com/g/reading-stacks)
