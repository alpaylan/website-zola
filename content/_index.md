Hi there! I'm Alperen Keleş, a 4th year Ph.D. Student at University of Maryland, College Park.
I focus on **property-based testing**, its implementations in different programming languages,
and its applications in the wild.

Some fun facts about me:

- I like to play [chess](https://lichess.org/@/alpaylan).
- I blog about programming, software engineering, research, in <a class="language-button tr" href="/posts?lang=tr">Turkish</a> and <a class="language-button en" href="/posts?lang=en">English</a>.
- I run a [reading group](/reading-group) at the intersection of computer science and software engineering.
- I've written [a document editor](https://www.tail.rocks) with a custom renderer from scratch.
- I've created a [puzzle](https://puzzle.alperenkeles.com) about a cryptic language, only 2 people other than me have solved it yet.
