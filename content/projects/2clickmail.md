2ClickMail is a small web tool I built to simplify mass emailing. It generates ready-to-send drafts using plain mailto links, which means that anyone can send a pre-written message in just two clicks. The idea came out of my own experience during the early days of the pandemic, when I used this method to help coordinate a campaign at METU.

The tool lets you save, edit, and organize your templates, and share them with others through a single link. This makes it easy to set up collective email actions—whether for petitions, reminders, or community projects—without needing a mailing list service.
I’ve written more about the motivation and technical details [in this post](https://alperenkeles.com/posts/2clickmail-2-clicks-to-change/) [and this one (in Turkish)](https://alperenkeles.com/posts/2clickmail-2-tikta-dunyani-guzellestir/).
